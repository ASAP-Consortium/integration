Please try to conform to this structure as much as possible. 
Otherwise, if it is necessary to follow your structure, please describe it to your project descriptor.

src/main/resources 	Project's resources
src/main/config 	  Main configuration files
src/main/scripts 	  Project's main scripts

There are textual documents meant for the user, such as README.txt, LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt, etc.

There are two main subdirectories: src/ and target/.

The target directory is used for all output of the build.

The src directory contains all of the necessary source code for building the project. 
It contains a subdirectory for each type: main/ for the main build artifact and test/ for the unit test code.
